Overview
Victoria McKenna is a Western woman -- tough on the outside, but soft on the inside. When her late father&#039;s cattle ranch on Wyoming&#039;s notorious Outlaw Trail is underhandedly sold to a stranger named Mason Mahaffey, Victoria prepares for a confrontation. But when she faces a handsome cowboy with five orphaned brothers and sisters, it&#039;s clear she&#039;s met her match.
