Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller Are you as obsessed with McFaddenâ€™s The Housemaid and the follow up, The Housemaid&#039;s Secret as we are? Then you are in for a treat as The Coworker is McFaddenâ€™s long awaited next tale of office secrets and the secrets behind the secrets. From the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of The Housemaid! &quot;Don&#039;t start a Freida McFadden book late at night. You won&#039;t be able to put it down!&quot;â€” Natalie Barelli, bestselling author of Unforgivable Two women. An office filled with secrets. One terrible crime that can&#039;t be taken back. Dawn Schiff is strange. At least, everyone thinks so at Vixed, the nutritional supplement company where Dawn works as an accountant. She never says the right thing. She has no friends. And she is always at her desk at precisely 8:45 a.m. So when Dawn doesn&#039;t show up to the office one morning, her coworker Natalie Farrellâ€”beautiful, popular, top sales rep five years runningâ€”is surprised. Then she receives an unsettling, anonymous phone call that changes everythingâ€¦ It turns out Dawn wasn&#039;t just an awkward outsiderâ€”she was being targeted by someone close. And now Natalie is irrevocably tied to Dawn as she finds herself caught in a twisted game of cat and mouse that leaves her wondering: who&#039;s the real victim? But one thing is incredibly clear: somebody hated Dawn Schiff. Enough to kill. The Coworker is a tense, unputdownable thriller from New York Times bestselling author Freida McFadden that explores the dark ways the past can echo through the presentâ€”with deadly consequences.
