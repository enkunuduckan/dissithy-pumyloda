Overview
Bestselling author Dorothy Garlock delivers a moving, nostalgic tale of Americana set in Oklahoma in the late twenties.
 The small town of Rainwater, Oklahoma, has become a notoriousboomtown now that a gusher has flooded its streets with drillers, welders, and roustabouts of every description. Jill, a spunky and hardworking young woman who runs the hotel for her aunt, is unprepared to cope with the attention she receives from the woman-hungry men. Despite her attempts to thwart their advances, she finds herself cornered by a group of men on the street one afternoon when Thad Taylor, a young neighbor, comes to her rescue. Believing Jill to be a &quot;street flapper,&quot; Thad makes it his duty to curb her wild ways. Jill wants nothing to do with Thad-until a woman is murdered in town. Now, Jill&#039;s finally accepted Thad&#039;s protection... but is she willing to accept more?
